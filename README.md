# Splatoon 2 Rotations
## A convienient way to keep track of the current Splatoon 2 game rotation

**Desired Features:**

* Shows current and future map rotations for all play modes: Turf, Ranked, League, and Salmon Run.

* Setup notifications for all sorts of things:
    
    * A particular map you want to play is in the rotation.
    
    * A particular play mode is in the rotation.
    
    * A rotation that you want to be reminded of when it goes live.
    
    * Any combination of all of these.

* Homescreen widget giving you quick access to the current rotations without having to open the app.

**What's Working Now?**

With the current code base in Master, I have basic functionality working in Portrait mode **only**. Landscape mode still needs some configuration to work properly, and from there, I'll start adding things like Salmon Run support, Widget support, Notification support, and eventually more pages for more information.
